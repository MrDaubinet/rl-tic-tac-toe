# Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an RL Agent

## The Game

### Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player competitive game where players take turns marking spaces with either X's or O's on a 3 x 3 grid. 

### Win condition
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Algorithms
Will touch on this more as I code

1. Temporal Difference Learning

2. Value based: Q-learning

3. Policy based: PPO

<br>

* Temporal Difference Learning is a method of learning from experience to predict future rewards. It is a combination of Monte Carlo methods and Dynamic Programming.

* Q-learning is a value based algorithm that uses a Q-table to store the value of each action in each state. The agent uses the Q-table to choose the best action to take in each state.

* PPO is a policy based algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the policy function. The agent uses the neural network to choose the best action to take in each state.
